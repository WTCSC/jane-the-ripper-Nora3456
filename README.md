<h1 align="center">Jane The Ripper</h1>
<h4 align="center">Otherwise known as... The Password cracker!</h4>

<p align="center"> This program allows you to potentially crack passwords! After using the program, you might be influenced to create a stronger, less common password...so use at your own risk!

## You might be wondering, how do you use this password cracker?

Below is a detailed step-by-step walkthrough of how to use the password cracker.
<br/> 

### First, how to run the program:

1. Save/copy the code. 
2. Create a new file (name it something simple that represents the code like 'Jane_the_ripper.py', or 'password_cracker.py').
3. Open your program/terminal and open the file you created.
4. Press the play icon (▶️) to run the script in the terminal!
<br/>


##  How to run the password cracker after opening the program:

- **REMEMBER: An MD5 hash is a function that generates a unique, 32-character hexadecimal string, from any input data**


1. 👋 | The Password Cracker will give you a quick welcome message.
 **NOTE: For inputs on step 2 & 3 make sure you list a valid file, you won't be able to proceed if you list a file that does not exist.**
2. 🤔 | Next, the password cracker will ask you for the path to your **hash** file. This is the file that contains a list of 'stolen' MD5 password hashes. If you are using the pre-given hash file input: "hashes.txt", then press enter.If you are inputting your own hash file, it must look similar to the pre-given hash file within this repository, that file looks like this: 

- <img src="hashes.preview.screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of a hash file example" width="300" height="190"/>

3. 👍👎 | For the final user required input, the password cracker will ask you for the path to your **wordlist** file. This is the file that contains a dictionary of common password guesses. If you are using the pre-given wordlist file input: "wordlist.txt", then press enter. If you are inputting your own wordlist file, it must look similar to the pre-given wordlist file within this repository, that file looks like this:
- <img src="wordlist_preview_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of a wordlist file example" width="300" height="190"/>
4. 🔍 | Finally, your code is shown! In your terminal should be a display of all the cracked passwords (if they were able to be cracked)!


## Want to create your own MD5 hash?

I see... you're interested in creating your own MD5 hash! Here's a simple step by step tutorial on how to do that: 
1. Create a new file on VS Code, name it something simple and clear like 'create_MD5_hash.py'.
2. Input the same code used in this image: 
- <img src="create_hash_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot reference code to create an MD5 hash" width="350" height="100"/>
3. Alter the information where the comments (# | hashtags) ask you to **replace** the information with your own words. 
 
4. Press the play icon (▶️) to run the script in the terminal!
5. View your hashed password in your terminal!
